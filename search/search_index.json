This wil execute locally the playbook \"test.yaml\", which will run some checks on the container where ansible-runner is being executed. <pre><code>oc apply -f examples/ansibleee-playbook-local.yaml\n</code></pre></p> <p>There are other examples that also execute locally the playbook \"test.yaml\", but that serve as extraMounts demonstration: ansibleee-extravolumes.yaml and ansibleee-extravolumes_2_secret.yaml that need the secrets ceph-secret-example.yaml and ceph-secret-example2.yaml created: <pre><code>oc apply -f ceph-secret-example.yaml\noc apply -f ceph-secret-example2.yaml\noc apply -f examples/ansibleee-extravolumes.yaml\n</code></pre></p> <p>There are also a number of examples that feature remote execution. By default, all of them expect a compute node to be available in 10.0.0.4, adjust the inventory accordingly for your environment.

This runs one of the standalone playbooks that is included in the default image.</p> <p>To access an external node, you need to provide the ssh private key so ansible can connect to the node.
